# Shaga-Node-Program

1) Started this game steup with anxity. But process is little dificult and time taking.
2) Its not easy way to get response from developers@shaga.xyz and understanding the our real time situation to setup game nodes.
3) Finally i just tryied hard but unable to reach the final steup.
4) While seeing all the documentation and images i was happy and feel to provide beeter feed back. But unfortunately unable setup the play ground.
5) I will try again, if possible i will send the actual feedback to  developers@shaga.xyz  mail.
6) #Note: submited this feedback to communicate with you for actual difficultes for developer setup. Not for bounty.
